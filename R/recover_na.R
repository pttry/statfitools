#' Recovers NA-values in data
#'
#' Using information disaggregated at different levels recovers protected information: NAs
#' in cells that would otherwise have values 1-4. Options to impute NA-values that cannot
#' be perfectly recovered.
#'
#' Note that randomization of the values that cannot be accurately allocated does not
#' guarantee that the values of resulting disaggregate data will summ to the values
#' of the aggregate data. Even allocation does ensure this.
#'
#' @param disaggr_data data.frame, contains the data for which NAs are to be recovered.
#' @param aggr_data data.frame, contains the date on one aggregation level above. This data
#' contains the additional information that is used to recovers NAs.
#' @param disaggr_col character, is the name of the aggregation class in disaggr_data and aggr_data.
#' @param aggr_col character, is the name of the aggregation class in aggr_data and disaggr_data.
#' @param var character, is the name of the variable for which NAs are to be recovered.
#' @param only_accurate logical, if TRUE, only replaces NA-values that can be recovered accurately.
#' Otherwise see \code{randomize_rest}. Defaults to FALSE.
#' @param randomize_rest logical, if TRUE, randomizes a value from 1:4 for those NA-values that cannot
#' be accurately recovered. If FALSE, evenly allocates the missing values as inferred from \code{aggr_data}
#' to replace NA-values.
#' @return data.frame Output is a data.frame disaggr_data with NAs recovered.
